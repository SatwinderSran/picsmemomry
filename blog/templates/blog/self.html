          <p class="lead">Fresh Bachelor's CS grad, ex consultant, & software intern, with high integrity and interpersonal skills searching for backend developer opportunities with a developing and driven team for a company that values transparency, teamwork, and personal growth. Experience through university research and internships required me to work heavily with AWS and many different types of databases on distributed networks. I have ample experience in Java, Python, C, Git, RESTful APIs, and SQL through countless of homework assignments and projects. With my bachelorâ€™s degree and internship, I feel like I am someone who can learn quickly and make an immediate impact. I am very eager to prove my worth and I believe that I can be a very perfect fit for any company.
